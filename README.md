# AWS-Serverless-Image-Processing-System
In this project, we implement an image-processing serverless application based on Amazon Web Service. Our project is similar to project 3, but when a user uploads something onto s3, it triggers the compress lambda, and at the end of the compress lambda function, it calls the rekognition function, which then calls the metadata function and once the metadata stuff is done, finalproj_metadata updates the jobs table and marks it as complete also, finalproj_download downloads the compressed jpg, the image labels, and the metadata, saves the compressed image to the client and outputs the labels and metadata onto console. Besides single image pipeline, we also provide two-image processing function. After images are uploaded and processed, clients can indicate a pair of images by their job_id and conduct histogram matching between the pair.
